<h1 align="center">Klyra Chain Proto</h1>

This directory defines all protos for `klyra chain`. We follow the Cosmos-SDK convention of using a tool called
[buf](https://github.com/bufbuild/buf) to manage proto dependencies. You can think of `buf` as being like `npm` for
protocol buffers. See the `buf` [documentation](https://docs.buf.build/how-to/iterate-on-modules#update-dependencies)
for further details.
